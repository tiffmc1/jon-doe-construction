## Technologies As Of July 14, 2023

- Vanilla ES6 JavaScript
- SASS/SCSS
- CDNJS -- icons & swiper functionality

## Game-Plan

<p>This website is an on-going, long-term project. Each tier represents the timeline in which this application is being built. The initial foundation is a clone from a previous application built for another project. It only contained a front-end, utilizing vanilla Javascript, semantic HTML, and SASS/SCSS. Tier 1 will be the process of moving that code into a larger framework which will be able to handle a more robust full-stack application.</p>

# Tier 1

- Install Next.js and move code into updated directory
- Change from being a single layout into multiple pages/layouts for users to navigate between
- Add input forms for users to be able to sign-up and login to their accounts (functionality added in Tier 2)
- Add input forms for a contact messaging system (functionality added in Tier 4)

# Tier 2

- Create user pages. Users should be able to create an account where they can view/update their account information and view their order history from the company
- Set up PostreSQL and Prisma for back-end
- Create user db model
- Add authentication for user login/sign-up functionality

# Tier 3

- Create services db model, which will include the type of service, price of that service per area, etc.
- Pull services data from the db and display onto services page for users to see

# Tier 4

- Add functionality for contact form
- Incorporate an admin account so admins can add, update, and/or delete order history information for users
